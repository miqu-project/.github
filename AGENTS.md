# AGENTS.md — Miqu Ecosystem Guidelines, Standards & Roadmap

> This document is the authoritative single source of truth for architectural contracts, configuration management doctrine, craftsmanship standards, build protocols, and active roadmaps across the Miqu desktop ecosystem.

## Author's Goal
> A fully functional Desktop Environment is the goal, but we are slowly making progress.

## Platform Base
- Currently we are leveraging an **Arch Linux** base.
- Other Linux distribution bases have not been tested yet.

## Configuration Management Golden Rules

Configuration management is the most critical architectural contract across the Miqu desktop ecosystem. It enforces absolute uniformity, predictable user customization, strict lifecycle safety, and zero hidden C++ magic.

---

### The Uniform Two-Tier Ecosystem Architecture

Every component across the entire Miqu ecosystem (`miquland`, `miqutoolkit`, and all downstream applications like `miqubar`, `miqudesk`, `miqumusic`, `miqulauncher`, etc.) strictly adheres to the **exact same Two-Tier Single-File Authority Model**:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 1: System Baseline (/usr/share/<app>/<app>.conf)  │
│  • Fully functional out of the box                     │
│  • Loaded ONLY if user config does not exist           │
└──────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┘
                           │ (when user creates config)
                           ▼
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 2: User Standalone (~/.config/<app>/<app>.conf)   │
│  • Generated on demand via '<app> --init-config'       │
│  • Safe timestamped archiving of existing config       │
│  • Loaded EXCLUSIVELY once it exists                   │
│  • Explicit 'source =' for dynamic themes/modules      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 1. Zero-Config Out of the Box (Tier 1: System Baseline)
- On a fresh system where `~/.config/<component>/<component>.conf` does not exist, the component executes directly from the authoritative system baseline at `/usr/share/<component>/<component>.conf`.
- No configuration files are **ever** auto-seeded or written to `~/.config/` automatically on launch. The entire desktop works immediately without polluting the user's home directory.

#### 2. On-Demand Initialization with Safe Timestamped Archiving
- A user configuration is created strictly on-demand when the user invokes `<component> --init-config`.
- **Safe Archiving**: If `~/.config/<component>/<component>.conf` already exists when `--init-config` is run:
  - It is **never** silently overwritten.
  - It is safely archived to `~/.config/<component>/<component>.conf.bak.<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>`.
  - A fresh, fully documented template is then written to `~/.config/<component>/<component>.conf`.
  - This prevents accidental data loss even if `--init-config` is invoked repeatedly.

#### 3. Single-File Standalone Authority (Tier 2: User Configuration)
- Once `~/.config/<component>/<component>.conf` exists, the component loads **only** that user file.
- There is **no hidden C++ background inheritance, no implicit layered merging, and no silent magic**. Every setting is explicitly visible and editable in one place.

#### 4. Decoupled Dynamic Theming via Explicit `source`
- `miqutoolkit` C++ code contains **zero hardcoded internal connections to `miqutheme`**.
- Instead, dynamic theming is completely decoupled and transparent:
  - Configuration files use the standard `source = ~/.config/miqutheme/current/miqutoolkit.conf` directive.
  - In `miqutoolkit.conf`, users who want dynamic wallpaper/palette changes from `miqutheme` explicitly include the `source` line.
  - Users who want completely static, pinned colors simply comment out or remove the `source` line and define their colors directly.
- Sourced files are automatically watched via inotify for live dynamic reload.

---

### Canonical Component Lifecycle Sequence
All ecosystem binaries implement the uniform configuration lifecycle:
```cpp
// 1. Resolve configuration path
std::string user_conf = FsUtils::get_user_config_file(app_name);
std::string target_conf = fs::exists(user_conf) ? user_conf : FsUtils::get_system_config_file(app_name);

// 2. Load exclusive configuration file (processes any internal 'source =' directives)
Config::get()->load_from_file(target_conf);

// 3. Register inotify watcher on loaded file and all sourced files for live reload
Config::get()->setup_config_watcher();
```

---

### Zero Source-Code Appearance Defaults
- Shared appearance tokens (colors, fonts, metrics, `icon_theme`) must **NEVER** have fallback magic literals in C++ struct initializers.
- All downstream applications must implement a `sync_defaults_from_toolkit()` pattern that queries `Config::get()`.
- This sync must be executed unconditionally on application startup and dynamically whenever an `engine->add_theme_change_listener()` callback is triggered.

---

## Component Responsibilities

---

## Active & Future Roadmap (TODO List)

1. **`miquctl` Comprehensive Compositor IPC Utility**: First-party CLI controller communicating with `miquland` over Unix domain socket (workspace switching/querying, window dispatching, monitor configuration, config reload, dynamic plugin management, and runtime diagnostics).
2. **Plugin System v2.0 (After `miquctl`)**:
   - Window & Workspace Event Bus (`on_workspace_switch`, `on_view_map`, `on_view_unmap`, `on_view_focus`, `on_monitor_change`).
   - Touchpad & Touchscreen Multi-Finger Gesture Hooks (3/4-finger swipe begin/update/end, pinch).
   - Per-Plugin Hook Isolation & Dynamic CLI Management (`miquctl plugin list`, `load <path>`, `unload <name>`).
   - Plugin-Defined Configuration Directives (parsed directly from `miquland.conf`).
   - Custom Tiling Layout Engine Registration API (enabling spiral, dwindle, monocle, master-stack plugins).
   - Pre/Post-Render & Frame Tick Hooks.
3. **Next Utilities & Applications**:
   - `miqushot` (screenshot utility)
   - `miqusunset` (gamma/blue light control)
   - `miqusettings` (centralized system settings)
   - Package manager front-end
   - `miqupower` (power management / session dialog)
4. **Configuration Parser & Legacy Alias Deprecation**: Deprecate redundant backward-compatibility wrappers and duplicate syntax in config parser.
5. **Privacy & Security Center (`miqusecure`) Extensions**: OpenSnitch frontend, 1-click Tor enabler, browser privacy advisor, security auditor, LUKS advice, firewall (ufw/nftables) selection, system restore points (Timeshift/Snapper OS snapshots).
6. **Touch Screen Gestures**: Multi-touch gesture recognition (swipes, pinch-to-zoom, edge gestures) for touchscreen devices.
7. **Virtual Machine Front-End**: Front-end utility to try out Linux distributions.
8. **Firefox Live Preview Fix in `miquoverview`**: Resolve subsurfaces / popup preview bounding in overview cards.
9. **Floating Window Improvements**: Review move/resize mechanics and config window rules.
10. **Window Border Shading & Gradient Colors (Ecosystem Phase 2 - Client Decorations)**: Extend gradient colors, multi-stop borders, and border shading to `miqutoolkit` views (`ViewGroup`, `CardView`) and client decorations.
11. **`miqutoolkit` Internal Animation Framework Implementation**: Implement a first-class, frame-driven animation engine natively inside `miqutoolkit` (supporting configurable easing curves, spring dynamics, opacity fades, geometry interpolations, and hover/focus transitions) to provide smooth, high-framerate UI animations across all downstream applications.
12. **`miqubg` Internal Animation & Cross-Fade Transition**: `miqubg` currently relies on `miquland` compositor animations by spawning a temporary second layer surface and tearing it down after a timer. Evaluate and implement native internal animation / cross-fading directly inside `miqubg` and `miqutoolkit` (rendering smooth image transitions inside a single persistent background surface without creating temporary secondary layer surfaces).
13. **Configuration Format Modernization (Lua / Advanced Scriptable Formats)**: Evaluate transitioning or expanding configuration formats across `miquland` and ecosystem components from custom key-value parsers to Lua (e.g. LuaJIT / Sol2) or other expressive configuration formats (enabling programmable rules, dynamic event callbacks, math expressions, and modular config architectures).
14. **Add separate `miqupluginmanager`**: Dedicated manager and utility to discover, install, update, enable/disable, and configure `miquland` plugins and extensions.
15. **`miqutheme` Auto-Seeding & Asset Layering Study**: `miqutheme` currently copies default schemes, wallpapers, and matugen templates into `~/.config/miqutheme/` on its very first launch (`ensure_directories_and_seed()`). Study and address potential loopholes (e.g. user directory pollution on startup, stale local copies when system schemes update upstream) and evaluate transitioning `miqutheme` to load system assets directly from `/usr/share/miqutheme/` while reserving `~/.config/miqutheme/` strictly for user-created custom wallpapers and palettes.
16. **Gamma Control in `miqubar`**: Implement gamma / blue light control module and flyout slider in `miqubar` (integrating with gamma control protocol / `miqusunset`).
17. **`miqunotify` Toast Layout & Shadow Fix**: Refine `miqunotify` notification toast rendering and layout—evaluate disabling drop shadows and guarantee notification body/action content stays strictly confined within the toast bounds without overflow or clipping.
18. **Special / Scratchpad Workspace Support in `miquland`**: Implement special workspace (scratchpad) functionality in `miquland` (toggleable overlay workspace, dispatching windows to/from special workspace, keybindings, and IPC controls).
19. **Website Automatic Dark Mode**: Add automatic dark/light theme switching to the official website (`miqu-project.github.io`) responding to the `prefers-color-scheme` media query alongside manual toggle persistence.

## Core Coding Craftsmanship Standards

### 1. Strict Layer Boundaries & Toolkit Sovereignty
- **Never bypass `miqutoolkit` in downstream apps**: Downstream applications must never interact directly with raw Cairo, Pango, or Wayland surface protocols when `miqutoolkit` provides (or should provide) the abstraction.
- **Push reusable controls into `miqutoolkit`**: If an application requires a UI widget (e.g. seekbars, dropdowns, cards, breadcrumbs), implement it inside `miqutoolkit` rather than authoring ad-hoc drawing routines in the application.
- **Permission required**: Seek user permission before editing `miqutoolkit` when developing downstream apps.
- **Full-stack evolution**: We are free to modify any layer of the stack—including the compositor `miquland`—if a protocol, hook, or capability is missing.

### 2. Aggressive Modularization & Anti-Slop Standards
- **Small, Single-Responsibility Functions**: Keep functions under ~40–50 lines. Decompose geometry calculations, input validation, and rendering into focused helper functions.
- **No God Classes**: Keep classes strictly scoped to a single domain. Avoid dumping miscellaneous state into monolithic managers.
- **Deep Modules with Narrow Interfaces**: Implement rich internal capability behind clean, minimal public APIs.

### 3. Lifecycle & Pointer Safety (Strict RAII)
- **No Zombie States or Silent Swallowing**: Check all system call returns, Wayland protocol calls, and toolkit APIs. Never swallow exceptions or leave half-initialized objects.
- **Pointer & Lifecycle Safety**: Never hold raw pointers to dynamic entities (`View*`, `Workspace*`, surfaces) without destroy listeners or validity guards against unexpected destruction (crashes, SIGKILL, dynamic pruning).
- **Deterministic Cleanup (Strict RAII)**: Every scene node, buffer, timer, listener, and memory allocation must have a verified destruction path. Dynamic reload/unload (`dlclose`) must cleanly unbind everything without dangling references.
- **Scope-Bound RAII**: Immediately wrap raw allocations, file descriptors (`int fd`), Cairo contexts (`cairo_t*`), and Pango layouts in `std::unique_ptr` with custom deleters or RAII guards. Never rely on manual cleanup before early error returns.

### 4. Event-Driven Confinement & Thread Safety
- **Zero Sleep-Based Synchronization**: Never use `sleep()` or `usleep()` to wait for state transitions or race conditions. Always use Wayland protocol callbacks, frame callbacks, event listeners, or event-loop idle handlers.
- **Main-Thread UI Confinement**: All Wayland protocols, Cairo/Pango rendering, and widget hierarchy mutations must happen strictly on the main event-loop thread.
- **Worker Thread Isolation**: Background threads (MPD, telemetry, sockets, async I/O) must communicate with the UI thread via `eventfd`, pipes, or event-loop idle dispatches—never touching widgets directly.
- **Safe Container Iteration**: Never mutate a container while iterating over it. Always work on a copy or use deferred removal queues. Guard signal emissions against re-entrancy.

### 5. Strict DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) & Zero Copy-Paste Duplication
- If a logic pattern, event dispatch loop, or geometry calculation repeats more than once, immediately extract it into a parameterized helper function.
- Never duplicate 30–50 line blocks across files with only trivial variable substitutions.

### 6. Reuse Existing Code First (Search Before Authoring)
- **Never reinvent the wheel**: Before authoring a helper, math calculation, geometry converter, or string utility, inspect the existing codebase.
- **Generalize existing helpers**: If an existing function provides 90% of what is needed, extend or generalize it cleanly rather than writing duplicate private variants.

### 7. Accurate Naming & Renaming Hygiene
- Names must accurately describe what the code does. Avoid vague identifiers (`temp`, `data2`, `helper`, `process`).
- If refactoring alters a method's scope or responsibility, immediately rename the method and update all call sites.

### 8. Zero Tolerance for Dead or Abandoned Code
- Immediately excise obsolete functions, unused variables, abandoned header declarations, and commented-out code blocks. Never leave "zombie code" behind.

### 9. Ripple-Effect & Blast-Radius Awareness (Zero Myopic Fixes)
- **System-Wide Impact Tracing**: Before modifying any shared structure, hook, or method signature, proactively trace its potential ripple effects across the entire ecosystem.
- **Zero Band-Aid Edits**: Never make isolated edits that solve an immediate symptom while breaking distant subsystems or introducing regressions.
- **Verify All Invariants & Call Sites**: Inspect all dependent call sites and downstream components to guarantee end-to-end architectural integrity.

### 10. Radical Candor & Intellectual Honesty (Zero Faking or Sycophancy)
- **Learn to Say "I Could Not Find", "Cannot Do", or "Sorry"**: Never fabricate non-existent APIs, hallucinate symbols, or invent broken workarounds.
- **Upfront Renderer & Protocol Reality Checks**: State hard protocol or low-level limitations upfront (e.g. stock wlroots surface clipping limitations without custom fragment shaders or scenefx).
- **Zero Pseudo-Solutions**: If a requirement is unfeasible or risks stability, state the limitations honestly and propose genuine architectural prerequisites.

### 11. Full-Stack Ecosystem Sovereignty & Zero Defensive Fallbacks
- **End-to-End Stack Control**: We design, build, and maintain the entire Miqu ecosystem (`miquland`, `miqutoolkit`, and all native apps).
- **No Speculative Fallbacks**: Never introduce defensive fallback branches, heuristic guesswork, or redundant fallback mechanisms for behaviors that we natively control and guarantee across our own stack.
- **Single Authoritative Pipeline**: Design one clean, protocol-driven contract across layers. Implement missing capabilities cleanly at their authoritative source layer.

### 12. Interface-First Design (Contract Precedes Implementation)
- Always design and validate public class interfaces, method signatures, data structures, and lifecycle contracts before writing implementation logic.

### 13. Opportunistic Refactoring
- If non-conforming or unmodular code is spotted during analysis of an unrelated task, offer to refactor that part.

## Build System & Installation Standards (`CMakeLists.txt` & `make.sh`)

Every component and application in the ecosystem adheres to a standardized, deterministic build and installation pattern.

### 1. The Standard `make.sh` Pattern
Every repository and downstream application contains a uniform, standalone `make.sh` (~20 lines) providing a consistent build-and-install lifecycle:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

BUILD_DIR="build"
BUILD_TYPE="${BUILD_TYPE:-Release}"

echo "==> Configuring <target> ($BUILD_TYPE)..."
cmake -B "$BUILD_DIR" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="$BUILD_TYPE" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr" "$@"

echo "==> Building <target>..."
cmake --build "$BUILD_DIR" -j"$(nproc)"

# Root auto-install check
if [ "${EUID}" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "==> Installing <target> to system (/usr)..."
    cmake --install "$BUILD_DIR"
    # ldconfig || true   # (Included for shared libraries like miqutoolkit)
    echo "==> <target> successfully installed to /usr!"
else
    echo "==> Built locally in $BUILD_DIR. To install system-wide, run: sudo ./make.sh"
fi
```
- **Idempotent Local Build**: Running `./make.sh` as an unprivileged user builds locally into `build/` without touching system directories.
- **Single-Command Root Install**: Running `sudo ./make.sh` configures, compiles, and automatically invokes `cmake --install` to `/usr`.
- **Argument Forwarding**: Passing `"$@"` allows forwarding custom CMake flags (e.g. `./make.sh -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`).

### 2. The Standard `CMakeLists.txt` Pattern
Downstream applications follow an identical, minimal structure:
1. **Core Standards & Compiler Flags**:
   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
   project(<app_name> LANGUAGES C CXX)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
   set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)
   ```
2. **Deterministic RPATH Configuration**:
   ```cmake
   # Guarantees the binary locates libmiqutoolkit.so without manual LD_LIBRARY_PATH hacks
   set(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib;$ORIGIN/../lib")
   set(CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH TRUE)
   ```
3. **Dual-Mode Toolkit Resolution**:
   Uses `pkg_check_modules` for installed systems, with an in-tree relative fallback for local dev trees:
   ```cmake
   find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)
   pkg_check_modules(MIQUTOOLKIT REQUIRED IMPORTED_TARGET miqutoolkit)
   
   # Local in-tree dev tree fallback
   if(EXISTS "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../miqutoolkit/build/libmiqutoolkit.so")
       target_link_libraries(<app_name> PRIVATE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../miqutoolkit/build/libmiqutoolkit.so")
   endif()
   if(EXISTS "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../miqutoolkit/include")
       target_include_directories(<app_name> BEFORE PRIVATE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../miqutoolkit/include")
   endif()
   ```
4. **Standard GNU Installations (`GNUInstallDirs`)**:
   ```cmake
   include(GNUInstallDirs)
   install(TARGETS <app_name> RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR})
   install(FILES assets/<app_name>.conf DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR}/<app_name>)
   install(FILES assets/<app_name>.desktop DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR}/applications)
   install(FILES assets/<app_name>.svg DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR}/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps)
   # Scaled PNG icons installed with RENAME <app_name>.png
   ```

### 3. Hierarchical Orchestration (`install_all.sh`)
- **Root `install_all.sh`**: Strictly enforces the topological dependency order:
  1. `miquland` (Compositor core & plugin development headers)
  2. `miqutoolkit` (Shared UI library, headers, pkg-config, templates, and `ldconfig`)
  3. `miqu-linux-apps` (Invokes the app suite installer)
- **Apps `miqu-linux-apps/install_all.sh`**:
  - Iterates over all 16 applications in ordered sequence.
  - Automatically detects stale `CMakeCache.txt` when directory locations change and resets the build directory.
  - Forwards CLI parameters (`"$@"`) to every individual `make.sh`.

---

## Tool Execution & Safety Restrictions

### 1. Sudo Command Restriction
- The AI agent must **never execute commands with `sudo`**.
- System installation commands requiring root privileges are always provided as instructions for the user to execute manually.

### 2. Local Test Builds Only
- For compilation verification and syntax checking during development, always build into the local project `build/` directory without sudo:
  ```bash
  ./make.sh
  ```
- Binaries and shared libraries built locally remain in `build/` strictly for validation.

### 3. Downstream Application Build Dependency Order
- All downstream applications dynamically link against `miqutoolkit`.
- **Authoring vs. Building**:
  - You **may** write, edit, and refactor code for downstream applications before updating `miqutoolkit`.
  - You **must NEVER** compile or test-build downstream applications until `miqutoolkit` has been rebuilt and installed.
- **Mandatory Step-by-Step Protocol**:
  1. Make edits to `miqutoolkit`.
  2. Validate compilation locally (`./make.sh` inside `miqutoolkit`).
  3. **STOP immediately**.
  4. Prompt the user to install `miqutoolkit` system-wide:
     ```bash
     cd miqutoolkit && sudo ./make.sh
     ```
  5. **Wait for user confirmation** that installation has completed before running `./make.sh` on any downstream application.

---

## Workflow & Collaboration Protocols

- **Git Staging, Commits & Push**: Always explicitly ask the user before staging, committing, or pushing git changes.
- **Visual Feedback Verification**: Visual output (colors, margins, padding, animations) cannot always be reliably verified programmatically. Ask the user directly for verification (e.g., *"Is the background showing red as expected?"*).
- **Configuration File Synchronization**: Whenever editing `/assets/*.conf`, ask the user whether to sync changes to `~/.config/` and vice versa.
- **Human Readability & Audit Pass**: For all vibecoded features and non-trivial patches, perform a dedicated cleanup pass to ensure the code is immediately human-readable, cleanly commented, free of cryptic boilerplate, and easily maintainable by human developers before submitting for review.
